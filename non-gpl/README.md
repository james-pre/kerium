# Kerium (non-GPL)

This is a separate package for Kerium that allows dependents to use Kerium without being bound by the GPL license.
It is intended to be used for proprietary and non-GPL-compatible kernel modules.

If you are making a frontend, you are free to use the GPL version of Kerium so long as you don't modify the kernel or otherwise violate the GPL license.
